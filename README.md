# Are-you-a-heart-patient
### Website to test whether you are at risk from heart disease or not!<br><br>
You can input patient's details in the website,<br>
and the website will predict if he/she is at risk or is safe<br><br>
I have used a dataset from Kaggle for training the model.<br><br>
Used Support Vector Classifier to train.<br><br>
Achieved an accuracy of >86%<br><br>
Website was made using Streamlit<br><br>
